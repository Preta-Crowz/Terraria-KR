        "Help_11": "I've also heard rumors that the power of the artifacts themselves may be further unlocked if you defeat the Old One's Army. Perhaps you could even use them any time you wish!",
        "Help_2": "You can use these artifacts to create traps and defensive towers. Doing so consumes Etherian mana, a special energy dropped only by members of the Old One's Army!",
        "Help_3": "Challenging the Old One's Army is rather simple. They are attracted to the power of the Eternia Crystals, and that can be used to bait them out.",

        "Help_5": "You'll want to place your Eternia Crystal stand in a pretty open, flat area. Lots of walls and stuff might make it pretty difficult to protect!",
        "Help_6": "Once your stand is set up, just interact with it while holding an Eternia Crystal, and prepare for a fight!",
        "Help_7": "Of course, you can't let the Old One's Army destroy the Eternia Crystal! This will have catastrophic consequences for my home world of Etheria!",
        "Help_8": "You can place defenses at the cost of 10 Etherian mana. Once placed, the Eternia Crystal will release some of this mana. Otherwise, you will need to defeat enemies to get more.",
        "Help_9": "With the help of the defenses, you will have to repel several waves of invaders who are attempting to destroy both you and the Eternia Crystal!"
